To obtain a digital certificate for the website I went to the website  https://certbot.eff.org/

On certbot I provided my server details of my html running apache on Linux(snap).

After providing these details the website provided steps to follow to obtain my digital certificate.

These steps involved ensuring the instance had snap installed and running a line of code provided by the website to generate the certificate.

I tested that the certificate worked by viewing the website and observing if I could view the certificate from the lock by the URL and confirmed it did work.
